 abstract = {The Literary Digest poll of 1936 holds an infamous place in the history of survey research. Despite its importance, no empirical research has been conducted to determine why the poll failed. Using data from a 1937 Gallup survey which asked about participation in the Literary Digest poll I conclude that the magazine's sample and the response were both biased and jointly produced the widly incorrect estimate of the vote. But, if all of those who were polled had responded, the magazine would have, at least, correctly predicted Roosevelt the winner. The current relevance of these findings is discussed.},

abstract="Issues of selection bias pervade criminological research. Despite their ubiquity, considerable confusion surrounds various approaches for addressing sample selection. The most common approach for dealing with selection bias in criminology remains Heckman's [(1976) Ann Econ Social Measure 5:475--492] two-step correction. This technique has often been misapplied in criminological research. This paper highlights some common problems with its application, including its use with dichotomous dependent variables, difficulties with calculating the hazard rate, misestimated standard error estimates, and collinearity between the correction term and other regressors in the substantive model of interest. We also discuss the fundamental importance of exclusion restrictions, or theoretically determined variables that affect selection but not the substantive problem of interest. Standard statistical software can readily address some of these common errors, but the real problem with selection bias is substantive, not technical. Any correction for selection bias requires that the researcher understand the source and magnitude of the bias. To illustrate this, we apply a diagnostic technique by Stolzenberg and Relles [(1997) Am Sociol Rev 62:494--507] to help develop intuition about selection bias in the context of criminal sentencing research. Our investigation suggests that while Heckman's two-step correction can be an appropriate technique for addressing this bias, it is not a magic solution to the problem. Thoughtful consideration is therefore needed before employing this common but overused technique.",

abstract="This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sample selection bias correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally stable algorithm.",

    abstract = "{Retrospective case–control studies are more susceptible to selection bias than other epidemiologic studies as by design they require that both cases and controls are representative of the same population. However, as cases and control recruitment processes are often different, it is not always obvious that the necessary exchangeability conditions hold. Selection bias typically arises when the selection criteria are associated with the risk factor under investigation. We develop a method which produces bias-adjusted estimates for the odds ratio. Our method hinges on 2 conditions. The first is that a variable that separates the risk factor from the selection criteria can be identified. This is termed the “bias breaking” variable. The second condition is that data can be found such that a bias-corrected estimate of the distribution of the bias breaking variable can be obtained. We show by means of a set of examples that such bias breaking variables are not uncommon in epidemiologic settings. We demonstrate using simulations that the estimates of the odds ratios produced by our method are consistently closer to the true odds ratio than standard odds ratio estimates using logistic regression. Further, by applying it to a case–control study, we show that our method can help to determine whether selection bias is present and thus confirm the validity of study conclusions when no evidence of selection bias can be found.}",

This paper highlights several graphical and algebraic methods capable of mitigating and sometimes eliminating this bias. These nonparametric methods generalize previously reported results, and identify the type of knowledge that is needed for reasoning in the presence of selection bias.  Specifically,  we derive a general condition together with a procedure for  deciding recoverability of the odds ratio (OR) from s-biased data. We show that recoverability  is feasible if and only if our condition holds.  We further offer a new method of controlling selection bias using instrumental variables that permits the  recovery of other effect measures besides OR.}
