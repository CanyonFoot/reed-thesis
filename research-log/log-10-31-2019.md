### Research Log

This week I ...
 - Continued with literature review, and compared/contrasted Hernan with Barienboim 2014. 
 - One thing I hadn't considered was that having $P(y|x)$ for $X = \emptyset$ gives $P(y)$, the population distribution of $Y$. This means that $P(y)$ is recoverable if and only if there is a collider in every path between $Y$ and $S$.
- Read through supplemental material for the Barienboim 2014 paper. 
.....

For next week, I plan to:

- Try to use results from Barienboim 2014 to get some less abstract rules for recoverability.
- Maybe start writing background?
