### Research Log

This week I ...


I have focused my reading on selection bias. Although there has been a lot of work in selction bias over the years - in many different fields - I am seeing three main areas where these papers are being published:

- There is older work in statistics and econometrics (Heckman 1979 appears especially influential) which operates in a parametric framework and is less general.

- There are a number of papers from the mid to late 2000s that approach the problem from a more principle oriented perspective (Hernan 2004, Geneletti 2009, Haneuse 2009) which are within the medical/epidemiology literature. These papers use the Pearl framework to varying extents but are more concerned with particular applications (case control studies, longitudinal studies) than with mathematical or graphical conditions for recoverability. These seem to be a precursor for much of the work we discussed last week (Bareinboim and Pearl). They also give some approaches to adjust for selection bias, especially with methods related to inverse probability weighting, which generally requires knowlegde of the true distribution.

- The most recent research is coming out of the machine learning world and is much more abstracted. This includes Bareinboim 2014, 2015, 2019. These papers are very techincal about the graphical aspects and honestly pretty hard to read (especially Bareinboim 2019). They deal with the problems of inference (classical and causal) under selection bias with and without unbiased (population representative) data.

My idea at this point is to look into applying the lessons from the last two categories to a new problem. One possibility that I have not seen anyone write about or even mention is the case where you have two selection biased data sets where the selection biasing variable is different between the two. So you might be interested in the conditional P(Income | Age) but all you have is a dataset that was selection biased by sex (say men oversampled) and one which was biased by education (say professional degrees overrepresented). Is there anything that can be done without using population level data? It might be that this is a really bad situation and not much can be done in general but I think it could be interesting to investigate.
.....

For next week, I plan to:

- After talking with Andrew tomorrow I might end up heading a different direction, but for now I would like to look into this problem of the two biased samples. It will help to get more comfortable with the graphical aspects of Pearl's SCM framework.
