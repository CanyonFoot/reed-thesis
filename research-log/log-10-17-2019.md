### Research Log

This week I ...
 - Prepared notes on d-separation for Andrew
 - Reread the selection bias paper with attention to proofs for Mark
 - I presented Mark will my version of the proof, although I had a slightly different idea of what he wanted me to do than he did. I followed his advice to create a more explicit counter example.
 - Began filling out the lit review with summaries of the most important papers.
.....

For next week, I plan to:

- Continue filling in literature review.
- Practice working with the relevant probability rules so I am more comfortable with the proofs
- Examine similarities/differences between the models of selection bias in Barenboim 2014 and Hernan 2004 since these both propose graphical explanations.
