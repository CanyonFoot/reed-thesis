### Research Log


Here is the situation (roughly):

Over break I spent most of my (somewhat limited) thesis time on finishing the Heckman section and writing the inverse probability weighting material. While doing that, I realized that the IPW literature is way larger than I realized and closely connected to propensity scores which have an even larger literature. This ended up being a time suck, but as I was reading I started to realize that part of the reason it was hard to formulate the IPW/PS section in terms of selection bias as I had defined it was because most of these techniques were designed for case where data was missing i.e. drop-out, survey non-response etc. This lead me to reading more on missing data and trying to add a small section to the beginning of the prior work chapter that went over the basics. However, on Sunday I saw that a fair number of papers by Judea Pearl and one of his grad students, Karthika Mohan had basically done the Bareinboim selection bias papers (graphical characterization, recovery conditions) on the missing data problem. This made me realize that I should build the graphical missing data material into its own section like I have done with Bareinboim. 

Unfortunately, I started too many strands without finishing them and have not pushed any work for a long time. However, my plan for now is to get a draft of the graphical missing data section done for next week, and once that is more or less done I will be able to finish up the prior work chapter more easily since the terminology I need will have been established. After that, I would like to take a look at what happens when both selection bias (as Bareinboim defines it) and missing data (as Mohan defines it) occur together. This is actually a very plausible situation - a survey might be non-representative and have incomplete answers or a medical study might suffer from Berkson's bias and also be subject to drop-out.
