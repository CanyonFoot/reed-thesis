### Research Log

This week I ...
 - Wrote 6 pages of review of previous literature
 - Got the bib working 
 - Worked a little more on the double selection example
.....

For next week, I plan to:

- Will talk with Andrew, but I need to finish the lit review section.

- While writing, I noticed that there are two broad approaches to adjusting for selection bias. The older techniques like IPW and Heckman depend on knoweldge of the selection mechanism, whereas newer graph based approaches tend to use external info on the observed variables. One path to explore might be if know something about selection mechanism can be interpreted in the graphical light.
